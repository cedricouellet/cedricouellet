<h1>ðŸ‘‡ About Me</h1>

I am quite passionate about programming in general, but I have a soft spot for working on the backend side of things, including database architecture and development. 

I often find myself staying up way too late tinkering on my new pet project... that is until I get bored of it and move on to start another completely different project 2 months later.
