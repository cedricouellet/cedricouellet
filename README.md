<h1>ðŸ‘‡ About Me</h1>

I am quite passionate about programming in general, but I have a soft spot for working on the backend side of things, including database architecture and development. 

I often find myself staying up way too late tinkering on my new pet project... that is until I get bored of it and move on to start another completely different project 2 months later.

I am also a big fan of the Microsoft's products in software development. Most of my projects deal with the .NET ecosystem at some degree.

For the past year or two, I've been primarily focusing on ASP.NET Blazor development to cure my JavaScript fatigue, although sometimes I find myself going back to JS.
