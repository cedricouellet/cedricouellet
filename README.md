<h1>👇 About Me</h1>

I began my journey as a code monkey about 6 years ago.

I am quite passionate about programming in general, but I have a soft spot for working on the backend side of things, including database architecture and development. 

I often find myself staying up way too late tinkering on my new pet project... that is until I get bored of it and move on to start another completely different project 2 months later.

When I get code fatigue, I sometimes spend some time doing CTF challenges to change things up.

<h2>🔨 The hammer to most of my nails</h2>

I am a big fan of Microsoft products for software development. Most of my projects are made using a product from the .NET ecosystem.

For the past year or two, I've been primarily focusing on ASP.NET Blazor development, especially WASM, to cure my JavaScript fatigue, although sometimes I find myself going back to JS. 

<h2>🕰️ What I am currently building in my downtime</h2>

I'm currently working on building an application suite using ASP.NET Core MVC, which I intend to name CAO Hub (very creative, I know 🙄).

The first module in the suite will be a receipt management app.

Why MVC? I wanted to go back to my roots, before Blazor came along.

I'm giving myself a challenge to create a modern-feeling app in a good 'ole MVC monolith using 3rd party libraries as little as possible (except for TailwindCSS).
That means building my own themes and custom controls as needed. No JQuery if I can help it!
